# Bubble sort is an algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted,
# compares each pair of adjacent items in the list and then swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
# The average case performance is O(n-squared), so this is not usually a preferred way of sorting stuff.

# A note about bubble sort and its refinements/relatives/offspring from Donald Knuth -
#
# "But none of these refinements leads to an algorithm better than straight insertion [that is, insertion sort];
#  and we already know that straight insertion isn't suitable for large N. [...] In short, the bubble sort seems
#  to have nothing to recommend it, except a catchy name and the fact that it leads to some interesting theoretical
#  problems."
