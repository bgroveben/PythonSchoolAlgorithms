Starting off with some sorting algorithms using Python 3.5.x

[Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) has a nice collection.

I think next up will be bubble sort and variants. 

[Toptal] (https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms) has some cool animations to check out.  

If you wish, you can watch the code executed step by step at [pythontutor.com] (http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)
