Starting off with some sorting algorithms using Python 3.5.x

[Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) has a nice collection.

[Wikibooks] (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation) also has a laundry list of algorithms.  

Up next: [Comb sort](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Sorting/Comb_sort)

[Toptal] (https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms) has some cool animations to check out.

If you wish, you can watch the code executed step by step at [pythontutor.com] (http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)
