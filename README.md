Moving on to some searching algorithms using Python 3.5 or Python 2.7.

Next up: [TheAlgorithms/Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)

### I have found useful information on the following sites:

From nryoung on [Github] (https://github.com/nryoung/algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/searching).  

[Python School](https://pythonschool.net/category/data-structures-algorithms.html).  

[NIST Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures] (https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads//).  

[Toptal] (https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms) has some cool animations to check out.  

[Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) has a nice collection.  

[Wikibooks] (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation) also has a laundry list of algorithms.  

If you wish, you can watch the code executed step by step at [pythontutor.com] (http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)
