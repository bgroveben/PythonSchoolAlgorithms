[NIST Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures] (https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads//).

[Toptal] (https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms) has some cool animations to check out.

Sorting Algorithms:

[Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) has a nice collection.

[Wikibooks] (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation) also has a laundry list of algorithms.
